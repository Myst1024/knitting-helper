## notes feature
- per project
- notes are placed at a specific location on a pdf by the user
- the notes render as a movable icon over the pdf
- pressing the icon opens an editable text window
- the note can be deleted (after confirmation) via a button in the text window
- multiple notes can exist in a single project, and multiple can be "open" with the text visible at one time
